      <p>
        Hi, I'm Barry. I'm a software engineer with a bachelor's degree in
						Computer Science from California State University, Los Angeles.
						Apart from developing on my freetime, I enjoy spending time with my
						family, traveling with my fiance, and cooking. When forced indoors,
					  I play with my cats, play video games, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring
						the latest technology advancements in the development world. My
						site contains projects, experience, and a learning blog. Feel free to
						send me a message if you have any questions. I
						will get back at you as soon as a possible. Thanks!
